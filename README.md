Age Classification Using CNN & LR

Age classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Reduced Logistic Regression (LR) is a technique used in machine learning and computer vision to predict the age group of individuals based on their images or visual data.
In the Age Classification program, we made code modifications to optimize the CNN model for age classification. By reducing the learning rate, we aimed to enhance the accuracy of the predictions.
